# Human follwing buggy using ROS (Robot operating system)

#The control is distributed across arduino, raspberry pi and laptop

#Arduino subscribes to motor speeds and publishes sensor readings (PIR and ultrasonic sensor readings)

#Raspberry pi subscribes to sensor readings and publishes motor speeds after taking necessary action based on motor speeds

#Obstacle detection while it follows human-WIP (Work in progress) (Currently no action is taken on ultrasonic sensor readings)
